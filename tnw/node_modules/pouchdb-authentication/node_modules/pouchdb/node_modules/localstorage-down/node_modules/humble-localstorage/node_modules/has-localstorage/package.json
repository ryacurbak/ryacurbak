  "readme": "# has-localstorage\n\n> returns true if localStorage is supported _and_ persistent\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gr2m/has-localstorage.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gr2m/has-localstorage/)\n\nreturns `true` or `false` depending on whether localStorage is supported or not.\nBeware that some browsers like Safari do not support localStorage in private mode.\n\n\n## Downlaod or Installation\n\n- Download [has-localstorage.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gr2m/has-localstorage/master/lib/has-localstorage.js)\n- or: install via Bower: `bower install --save has-localstorage`\n- or: install via npm: `npm install --save has-localstorage`\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nif (hasLocalStorage()) {\n  // localStorage can be used, all data gets persisted\n} else {\n  // localStorage is not available, or changes are not persisted\n}\n```\n\n\n## Help wanted!\n\nThe current test setup is very simple: it only tests in latest Firefox\nusing Selenium and [Sauce Labs](http://saucelabs.com/). Unfortunately,\nSauce Labs has no support to start browsers in private mode, which would\nbe necessary, as `localStorage` behaves different if in private mode\nin Safari, probably in other browsers as well.\n\nIf anynone has an idea to for that, ping me at\nhttps://github.com/gr2m/has-localstorage/issues/1\n\n\n# Acknowledgement\n\n`hasLocalStorage()` has been inspired by this [Cappuccino](http://www.cappuccino-project.org/) commit:\nhttps://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/commit/063b05d9643c35b303568a28809e4eb3224f71ec\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
